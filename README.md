# DiscordCommandLine - DSC - (WIP)
A command line version of discord, made to be lightweight. 

# WARNING:
DCL is going under a full rewrite at the moment, and from this rewrite a library will be produced for better maintainability and user customization. You should check out DCLR on the rewrite branch. It's optimized and efficient.

Hlp - displays this page\r\nMsg (your message) - shoots a message to the current channel without parentheses

Bck - takes you back one step

Lod - allows you to recieve messages from the current channel.

Clr - Clears the current message buffer manually.
